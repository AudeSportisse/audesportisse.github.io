Since October 2024, I am a CNRS researcher in the [APTIKAL](https://lig-aptikal.imag.fr/) team of the Computer Science Laboratory of Grenoble [LIG](https://www.liglab.fr/en).

From October 2023 to the end of Septembrer 2024, I was a junior fellow in [Efelia Côte d'Azur](https://univ-cotedazur.fr/efelia-cote-dazur).

From October 2021 to the end of September 2023, I was a Postdoctoral researcher of the [3iA Côte d'Azur](https://3ia.univ-cotedazur.eu/) at Centre Inria d'Université Côte d'Azur in the Maasai team. I was working on deep semi-supervised learning, with [Charles Bouveyron](https://math.univ-cotedazur.fr/~cbouveyr/) and [Pierre-Alexandre Mattei](https://pamattei.github.io/).

My PhD thesis (2018-2021) in Applied Mathematics was supervised by [Claire Boyer](https://perso.lpsm.paris/~cboyer/) and [Julie Josse](http://juliejosse.com/) at Ecole Polytechnique (CMAP) and University Pierre and Marie Curie (LPSM). See [dissertation](/files/these_archivage_3300796.pdf), [slides](/files/Slides_PhD_Defense_Sportisse.pdf). 

The goal of this PhD thesis was to propose new statistical methods to handle missing values in several supervised and unsupervised machine learning scenarios, particularly when the data can be Missing Not At Random (MNAR), i.e. when the unavailability of values depends on the missing values themselves and values of other variables. We have considered low-rank models (fixed and PPCA), online linear regression using SGD and model-based clustering.
